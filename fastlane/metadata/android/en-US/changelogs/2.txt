Second experimental version. 

* Now has 17 built in levels
* Better obstacle generation (taking into account low, mid, and high frequencies)
* Slightly better physics
* Reduced filesize by downsampling songs (but generating obstacles from the high bitrate version)

Please feel free to provide feedback so we can make this as fun and challenging as can be.
