Improvement: Allow deleting custom levels.

Remaining known limitations of custom levels:
 * Levels are slow to generate, fail on lower end devices
 * UX is a clunky when adding a new world, UI is not yet internationalised

The custom levels feature is still in beta. Any feedback or bug reports welcome.
